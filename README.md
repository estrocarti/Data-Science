# Email Classification with Naive Bayes
## Project Overview
This project aims to categorize emails into different classes (e.g., spam, ham, promotional, social) using the Naive Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness. This README provides an overview of the project, including its motivation, technical details, how to set it up, and use it.
## Motivation
Email classification is a crucial task for both individuals and organizations to manage their emails effectively. The sheer volume of emails received daily necessitates automated tools to sort emails according to their relevance and importance. This project leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm to accurately classify emails, helping users focus on emails that matter most.
##Features
   * Email Preprocessing: Implements advanced text preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare email data for classification.
   * *Naive Bayes Classification: Utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails, trained on a dataset of manually categorized emails.
   * Performance Evaluation: Employs metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.
   * Real-world Testing: Includes a simulation of real-world email classification to demonstrate the model's effectiveness over time.
## Technologies Used
   * Python 3.x
   * Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK
## Prerequisites
   * Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
